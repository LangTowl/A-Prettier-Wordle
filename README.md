---
### A simple clone
**A Prettier Wordle** is a very simple clone of the popular [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) game, but with a slightly more stylized UI.

### Features
- Pool of 2316 5 letter words, of which one is selected every time the app is opened
- Algorithm to detect correct, partially correct, and incorrect words present in the word
- Submit button that checks to see if the word is present in the pool before submitting the guess
- Delete button
- Re-roll button which clears the board and generates a new word

### Known issues
- The algorithm that updates the colors of the board and keyboards sometimes gets confused when the word of the day has either double or triple redundant letters
